# yet-another-password-list-unifier (YAPLU)

This program is designed to combine passwords from different password managers without duplicates or missing passwords from one or other password base. 
Designed for users who have used several password managers in parallel and decide or use one or go to another (or to others)

To use the program, export passwords from password managers in the CSV format and put them in a program folder for convenience.

Be very careful! Export the password database only in a protected environment! CSV files are recorded in plaintext and can be read by attackers even after they are removed from the computer!

Initial release (0.1a) provides functionality to unify Apple KeyChain and 1Password bases. Output CSV was successfully imported to Bitwarden during tests.
